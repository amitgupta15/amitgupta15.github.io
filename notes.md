Hi, I'm Amit Gupta.

I'm a freelance <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. I have been developing software for more than 18 years. I specialize in tailoring software solutions that are best fit for my clients based on their business requirements and budget. I have worked on a wide range of projects varying in size, scope and technology for industries such as Utility, Hospitality, Commodity Trading, etc.

For the past few years, I have been focusing more and more on <strong>NodeJS</strong> for server side development and <strong>React/Javascript</strong> for the front end development. I have also worked extensively with <strong>Java/Spring Boot</strong> for server side development and <strong>AngularJS</strong> for front end.

                    <p>
                        I work on continously sharpening my skills and learning new skills and technology. Sometimes, I like to go back and revisit/refresh my
                        knowledge. Here's a brief list of courses/certifications I recently undertook.
                    </p>

                <h3>Books</h3>
                <p>Another way I like to hone my skills is by reading technical books. Here's a list of books I have read and some I'm still working on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refactor - Martin Fowler</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>People</h3>
                <p>I have learned from a lof of people either by reading their books or their blogs and some have made a significant impact on the way I develop software and think about software</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Robert C. Martin - learned how to write clean code, what it actually means</li>
                    <li>Martin Fowler - helped me solidify the concepts I learned by reading Bob Martin.</li>
                    <li>Jen Simmons - CSS Guru. Learned quite a lot about CSS from Jen Simmons</li>
                    <li>Ryan Florence - Really loved his blogs and tutorials.</li>
                    <li>Dan Abramov - ReactJS</li>
                    <li>Todd Motto - Learned how to write clean AngularJS code from Todd. Amazing teacher.</li>
                    <li>Christina Troung - She has a wonderful CSS course on LinkedIn learning. I had been writting CSS but after taking her course, I actually understood a lot of more about CSS. She also mentions a lot of great css resources in her course.</li>
                    <li>Guy who taught me NodeJS - Learned how to write code in bare bones javascript for NodeJS. Learned a lot about developing my own MongoDB type database. Now I am so much more comfortable coding in Javascript on the server side.</li>

                    <h3>Came across <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">Tania Rascia's</a> blog...</h3>
                    <span>07/23/2019</span>
                    <p>
                        Dan Abramov mentioned <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">Tania's</a> blog in one of his twitter posts recently, so I decided to take a look.
                        Tania is a self taught web developer who have developed some pretty cool websites. I spent some time reading her blog and I'm going through her <a href="https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/">CSS library</a>.
                        Her work is really helpful since I myself am trying to learn the nuances of CSS. I want to build responsive sites without using Bootstrap.
                        I'll use my own site to experiment with CSS and get better.
