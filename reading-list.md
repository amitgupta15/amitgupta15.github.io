- **[Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493766996&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code)**
  ([Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1))

  First when I saw that a whole chapter is dedicated to "Meaningful
  names", I could not believe my eyes. I mean how much can you write
  about meaningful names. I gladly admit I was wrong. I read the entire
  chapter twice.
  [Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)
  taught me things I didn't know I needed to learn. This is by far the
  best book on coding.


- **[Agile Software Development - Principles, Patterns, and Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)** ([Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1))

  I have never done pair programming myself but I learned how effective
  pair programming can be from Chapter 6 - Programming Episode. The book
  is also articulates the merits of SOLID principles of software
  development.

- **[Refactoring - Improving The Design of Existing Code](https://smile.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)** ([Martin Fowler](https://smile.amazon.com/Martin-Fowler/e/B000AQ6PGM/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1493838906&sr=8-1))

  Refactoring is an ongoing process. It should never stop as long as
  code is alive and is being regularly updated. You also need proper
  supporting code such as unit tests, etc. to refactor with confidence.
  This book teaches you how to detect code smells and fix those with
  principled refactoring process.

  [Head First Design Patterns](https://smile.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1493934073&sr=1-1&keywords=head+first+design+patterns)**
  (Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates)

  Patterns are an integral part of good software design. Strategy,
  Decorator, Template, Iterator, Factory are some of the patterns every
  programmer should know. I read this book for the first time in 2006.
  Since then I have read it a few more times and I keep it on my desk as
  a reference.
