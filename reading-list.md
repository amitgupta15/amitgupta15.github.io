- **[Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493766996&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code)**
  ([Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1))

  First when I saw that a whole chapter is dedicated to "Meaningful
  names", I could not believe my eyes. I mean how much can you write
  about meaningful names. I gladly admit I was wrong. I read the entire
  chapter twice.
  [Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)
  taught me things I didn't know I needed to learn. This is by the best
  book on coding.


- **[Agile Software Development - Principles, Patterns, and Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)** ([Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1))

  Chapter 6 - Programming Episode is my favorite chapter in this book.
