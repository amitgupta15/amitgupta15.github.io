- **[Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493766996&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code)**
  ([Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1))

  First when I saw that a whole chapter is dedicated to "Meaningful
  names", I could not believe my eyes. I mean how much can you write
  about meaningful names. I gladly admit I was wrong. I read the entire
  chapter twice.
  [Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)
  taught me things I didn't know I needed to learn. This is by the best
  book on coding.


- **[Agile Software Development - Principles, Patterns, and Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)** ([Robert C. Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1))

  I have never done pair programming myself but I learned how successful
  pair programming should work from Chapter 6 - Programming Episode is
  my favorite chapter in this book. The book is also a very articulate
  primer on SOLID principles of software development.

- **[Refactoring - Improving The Design of Existing Code](https://smile.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)** ([Martin Fowler](https://smile.amazon.com/Martin-Fowler/e/B000AQ6PGM/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1493838906&sr=8-1))

  Refactoring is an ongoing process. It should never stop as long as
  code is alive and is being regularly updated. You also need proper
  supporting code such as unit tests, etc. to refactor with confidence.
  This book teaches you how to detect code smells and fix those with
  principled refactoring process.
