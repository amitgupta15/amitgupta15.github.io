Test Driven Development is an emotional subject for developers. Some
love it and some hate it. Some have even declared it dead (
[TDD is dead. Long live testing](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html)).
In my personal experience, TDD is indispensable to the practice of
writing good code. I may not follow every principle in letter but I do
follow TDD in spirit.

Let's write a Doubly Linked List in Java to demonstrate TDD. The
algorithm for doubly linked list is adopted from [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002900.html)
