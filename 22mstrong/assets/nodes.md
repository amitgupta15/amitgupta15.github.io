Hi Amit, 

Please find a wetransfer file with the assets for the home page included in the link below. Let  me know if you need them delivered in a different way and we'll adjust. 

This is only the home page, as we are still working on the subpages but wanted to get to you so you can start building as this is the first page our visitors will see so we want it to be really eye catching and it will probably take the most time to build out.

I the folder you will the Illustrator files. Please not, the background file which can be found in links won't actually be used. We'll be using the video movie files located in the "Videos" file. 

We've included 3 videos:
Background Video: This folder has (2) videos one is a .mov, the other a .mp4. Not sure which you wanted to use. We are still looking for additional landscape videos to include on the back end, but the front end is final. 

For Timing: This folder has (1) video that you can use for timing. We want the website to start to appear at roughly the 25 second mark. We want the text The Future of Renewable Energy Is Here to appear, then move to the top of the page the buttons fill out below. Should be similar to what we sent last week and discussed.

Additional notes: 
As discussed, users won't need to watch the video every time they visit the site. We'll have another video that just has landscape videos running in the background with the buttons already loaded for return visitors. We are working on that video as it will match included video (Just without the opening globe shot)

On the home page, the globe should pulsate a little bit, pleae let me know what size the GIF should be and we'll get over to you. Is there a way for it to be a link that opens an overlay video player? We are also shooting a spot that discusses just what the future of energy means. 



Let me know if you'd like to hop on a call to discuss.
