        <p>
          Like wind and solar, natural gas can come from renewable sources. Itâ€™s made from waste, generated by wastewater treatment and landfills as well as plant and animal waste. Because it comes from naturally occurring sources such as these, it is ruled out as a fossil fuel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The RNG production process starts as methane is released from the decomposition of organic materials. The methane is immediately captured, cleaned, injected back into the natural gas pipeline or used directly and then can be dispensed as energy to power buildings, homes and vehicles.
