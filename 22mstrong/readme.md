1) I'm noticing the choppiness as well. Should we do smaller exports for the video? 
2) The globe is quite large, can you make it about 60 percent smaller? The top of the glow on the globe should be roughly the same height as the top of the upper button, and the bottom of the lower button. 
3) Will you make the buttons react when scrolled over? Unless, since they don't link out yet, there is not reaction? 
4) Can we add a bit more space between SOLAR and TIPS as well as WIND and NEWS. Basically, lower Tips and news a bit further down the page. Use the wireframe as a reference. 
5) We'll also need to make sure there is a footer with the SoCalGas Logo. 
6) Lastly, regarding the opacity, I think it is perfect. Is there any way to start it when the buttons appear? That way it doesn't darken the white "22 MILLION Strong text"

Great Job Amit. Can't wait to see the sub pages come together. I know those should be a bit more straight forward.
