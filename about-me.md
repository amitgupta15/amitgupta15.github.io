Hi, I'm Amit Gupta. I am a software development consultant in Rancho
Cucamonga (Los Angeles). I've been turning keystrokes into software
applications for the past 15 years. I started my professional career in
the post dotcom burst era at a tiny startup.

I was a
[ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_ColdFusion) developer
before I learned Java. I've been developing in Java and Spring Framework
since 2009. I picked up Javascript a couple of years ago and I'm loving
it. I have couple of projects under development in Javascript with
Node.js and MongoDB. I also learned AngularJS and I like the flexibility
AngularJS provides to develop front end.

I'm a TDD enthusiast. I believe good unit tests are absolutely essential
for quality software. I always use "test first" approach whether I
develop in Java or Javascript.

I like to learn new programming languages and technologies. I have been
experimenting with Kotlin lately. I am also inspired by Machine Learning
and Microservices. I'm trying to find some time to write some
experimental code for these technologies.
