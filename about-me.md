I'm a software developer. In the past 15 years, my fingertips have
turned keystrokes into many small and large software applications. Like
many developers who started their careers in post dot-com-burst era, I
took the first job offer I got. It was a small startup company and I
wasn't very picky (I don't think I had that luxury). I agreed to
whatever pay I was offered and was just happy to have a job.

Since then I have grown older (and perhaps wiser). I have had
opportunities to work on several projects, languages and frameworks.
